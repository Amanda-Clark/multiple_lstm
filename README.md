Using multiple layer LSTMs on some Stackexchange data

Some exploration of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Stackexchange using multiple LSTMs. This is one of my favorite 
Stackexchange sites to use for machine learning, as it 1. Has lots of data 2. Is in English and doesn't have code blocks and 
other technical stuff that I am not sure works well with NLP.
